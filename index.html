          <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the Openw=WeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
          </p>
          <p>After assesmbling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source daata and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlation witnessed.
